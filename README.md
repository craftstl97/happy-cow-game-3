# Happy Cows 3

In this project I have implemented the Iterative Deepening Depth First Search algorithm to the happy cows framework (see happy cows 1)

- Placements require 7 points for success
- ID-DFS should try to place the minimum number of cows to get 7 points

run.sh takes an input and output file test.sh takes only a grid size test.sh will generate 5 random grids of the given size and print their solutions Not every random grid will have a solution, so after attempting all possible placements it will print "Failed!" and move on to the next test
